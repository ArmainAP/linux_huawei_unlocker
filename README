Huawei wireless broadband modems are well supported in Linux. When bought from
a mobile carrier they are often locked to that carrier's network. This restricts
your freedom to choose your own supplier and SIM.

Unlocking these modems is simple but it has become the domain of malign and
unscrupulous members of the underground warez scene. This program aims to
simplify the process for Linux users.

Method:
	1. Insert the "foreign" SIM into your modem
	2. Insert the modem into a spare USB port. Do not attempt to connect.
	3. Run "./unlocker.py" (you may need to run this as root)
	4. Accept the warning by typing "YES"
	5. Confirm you wish to proceed with the unlocking procedure
	6. Let me know whether it was a success or failure!

Troubleshooting:
	Make sure python-2 and pySerial are installed
		(e.g. sudo apt-get install python-serial)

	The Windows "Dashboard" software is untouched. Some carrier-modified
	versions of this software prevent unlocked modems connecting to foreign
	networks. You may need to update the Dashboard software to an unbranded
	version. This is of no concern to Linux users and this software does
	not help with that process.
